To get started with your GPIO Xmas Tree for the
Raspberry Pi, type the following at the command prompt:

sudo python example_1.py

You can then try the other examples:

example_1.py : each LED on in turn
example_2.py : several LEDs on at once
example_3.py : one LED off each time, all the others on
example_4.py : all LEDs flashing on and off simultaneously
example_5.py : random LEDs
example_bicolour : an example with the Kickstarter bicolour LED

For bicolour example, make sure you edit tree.py and set
bicolour_fitted to True.
